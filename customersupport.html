<p>Measure the employee accurately so that the uniform will fit properly. Hold the tape measure firmly, but not tightly, and be sure it is straight and level. Record measurements on the Uniform Requisition.</p>

<p>Measuring Male Employees </p>
<p>Measure male employees by following these steps:</p>
<p>Height - Have the employee stand straight against a wall in stocking feet. Make a mark level with the top of the head. Measure from this point down to the floor.</p>

<p>Chest - Make sure the employee is standing in a natural position. Measure employee well up under arms across shoulder blades and over fullest part.</p>

<p>Waist - Measure over shirt (but not over trousers) at the position the employee normally wears his trousers, or measure the waistband of a well-fitting pair of slacks (zipper up and closed) of the same style.</p>

<p>Neck - Measure around the neck where a buttoned shirt would fit. Be sure tape measure is neither tight enough to choke nor loose enough to sag.</p>

<p>Sleeve - Measure from the middle of the back of the neck, across the shoulders, and around the point of the elbow to the wrist bone.</p>

<p>Inseam - Measure well - fitting slacks of the same style along the inner seam from the crotch seam to bottom of leg.</p>
